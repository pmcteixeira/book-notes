# Notes

## About

This is a note collection of things that I've read, inspired by [30 second habit lifelong impact](https://medium.com/swlh/the-30-second-habit-with-a-lifelong-impact-2c3f948ead98#.qyzhf8ghw). I realized I was forgetting the lessons I'd learned from past books and articles. So I started taking detailed notes, especially with technology subjects where I need quick reference.
